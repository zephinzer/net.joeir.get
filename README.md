# net.joeir.get

A re-attempt to connect with my inner-frontend (who am I kidding? ðŸ¤£)

# Visit

To see this in action, go to [https://get.joeir.net](https://get.joeir.net).

# Reminders To Self (AKA Runbook)

## Working On This?

Go ahead run `make start`.

> This should start a development server at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## Deploying?

Go ahead run `make deploy`.

> This should deploy the site onto a `gh-pages` branch and push it

## Building a Container?

It's kinda useless but: `make package`.

> This requires Docker and should result in an image named `zephinzer/net-joeir-get:latest` being created.

## Pushing to Docker Hub?

Because you can: `make publish`.

> For fun and profit probably
